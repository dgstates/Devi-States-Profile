    <p>Devi Gurung States is dedicated to helping others. He has advanced degrees in technology, health science, public health, social work, and healthcare informatics. When he was 15, he lost his parents and became homeless in Kathmandu. After almost two years on the streets, he met his American foster father, Dr. James States, who brought him to the United States in 1983. This tough experience made him want to help others, especially women and children.</p>

He also owns Everest Cafe and Bar, where he encourages healthy living. He wants to become a university teacher and keep working for social justice.
